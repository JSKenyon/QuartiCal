# QuartiCal

QuartiCal is the successor to CubiCal. It implements a suite of fast radio interferometric calibration routines exploiting complex optimisation. Unlike CubiCal, QuartiCal allows for any available Jones terms to be combined. It can also be deployed on a cluster (more information to follow).

## Installation

At present, installing QuartiCal requires cloning the repository and installing from source. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended. Once it is released, QuatiCal will be installable using `pip`. 


## Documentation

Documentation will eventually be available on [readthedocs](http://quartical.readthedocs.io).


## Licence

QuartiCal is not yet liscenced (TBD).
