Utilities
=========

In order to make using and experimenting with QuartiCal a risk-free process,
several command line utilitites are available to users.

goquartical-backup
------------------

This command line utility allows users to back up any measurement set column
to a compressed zarr format. The utility will automatically attach time and
measurement set info to the backup. This utility is invoked using:

.. code:: bash

    goquartical-backup path/to.ms path/to/backup/directory column

Help is available and can be accessed by running ``goquartical-backup -h``.

The main purpose of this utility is to allow users to back up flags and 
weights which may be altered by the calibration process.

goquartical-restore
-------------------

This command line utility allows users to restore a back up measurement set 
column generated by ``goquartical-backup`` to the measurement set. This allows
users to easily revert unwanted changes to the measurement set caused by e.g.
a bad calibration run causing excessive flagging or user error. This utility
is invoked using:

.. code:: bash

    goquartical-restore path/to/backup path/to.ms column

Help is available and can be accessed by running ``goquartical-restore -h``.

goquartical-config
------------------

This command line utility generates an unpopulated .yaml file containing
all available options. This can be edited as needed by a user. This utility is
invoked using:

.. code:: bash

    goquartical-config path/to/config.yaml
