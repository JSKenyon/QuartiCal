  solve_per:
    dtype: str
    default: antenna
    choices: [antenna, array]
    info:
      Determines whether this term should be solved per antenna (conventional)
      or over the entire array (doesn't vary with antenna).

  direction_dependent:
    dtype: bool
    default: False
    info:
      Determines whether this term is treated as direction dependent.

      Number of timeslots/amount of time to include in a single solution.
      Specify as an integer number of timeslots, or a value with a unit
      (e.g. '300s'). 0 means use full time axis.

  freq_interval:
    dtype: str
    default: "1"
    info:
      Number of channels/bandwidth to include in a single solution. Specify as
      an integer number of channels, or a value with a unit (e.g. '128MHz').
      0 means use full frequency axis.

  load_from:
    dtype: Optional[str]
    info:
      Load solutions from given database.

  interp_mode:
    dtype: str
